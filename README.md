Welcome to the official codebase for the Luqman Cyber website. This project is a modern, responsive, and fully static web application designed to showcase our services in Namanga.

## Project Overview

We built this website to be fast, professional, and easy to use on any device. It doesn't require a complex server or database—it just works. This makes it incredibly reliable and easy to host anywhere.

## Key Features

*   **Modern Design:** We used a vibrant "Vivid Sky Blue" theme with glassmorphism effects (frosted glass look) to make it feel premium.
*   **Fully Responsive:** The site adapts perfectly to mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. You get a sidebar menu on phones and a full navigation bar on laptops.
*   **Interactive Elements:**
    *   **3D Tilt Cards:** Hover over services on a computer to see them rotate in 3D.
    *   **Typewriter Effect:** The hero section types out our services automatically.
    *   **Floating Animations:** Subtle moving shapes in the background to keep the site feeling alive.
*   **Touch-Friendly:** All buttons and links are sized for easy tapping on touchscreens.
*   **Contact Integration:** Direct links to WhatsApp, Phone, and Email for immediate support.


## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and semantic layout.
*   **CSS3:** For all the styling, animations, and responsive layout.
*   **JavaScript:** For the interactivity (mobile menu, theme toggle, animations).
*   **Font Awesome:** For the icons used throughout the site.
